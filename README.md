### Welcome to my profile 

My name is Ernest, and I am a Louisiana Tech taught Computer Scientist interested in embedded systems!

- I'm currently working on my [man_in_box](https://github.com/Ernestover/man_in_box) simulation and fixing my [website's](https://www.erneststovera.com) appearance on mobile devices
- I'm currently learning what embedded systems are and how they work
- Something about me is I try to learn something new everyday
